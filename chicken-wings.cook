Adjust #oven rack{} to upper-middle position and preheat oven to 450F (230C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with #aluminum foil{} and set a #heat-proof wire rack{} inside.

Pat dry @chicken wings{4%lbs} liberally with #paper towel{}, squeezing out as much moisture as you can. Trans them to a #large bowl{}.

In a #small bowl{}, combine the @aluminum free baking powder{1%tbsp}, @garlic powder{2%tsps}, @salt{1/2%tsp}, @cracked pepper{1%pinch}

Arrange on rack, leaving about 1-inch of space between each wing.

Bake for ~{30%minutes}; flip and continue to cook until crisp and golden brown, (about ~{20-30%minutes} longer), until golden browned and crispy.
